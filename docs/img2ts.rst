Conversion to time series format
================================

For a lot of applications it is favorable to convert the image based format into
a format which is optimized for fast time series retrieval. This is what we
often need for e.g. validation studies. This can be done by stacking the images
into a netCDF file and choosing the correct chunk sizes or a lot of other
methods. We have chosen to do it in the following way:

- Store only the reduced gau√üian grid points since that saves space.
- Store the time series in netCDF4 in the Climate and Forecast convention
  `Orthogonal multidimensional array representation
  <http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#_orthogonal_multidimensional_array_representation>`_
- Store the time series in 5x5 degree cells. This means there will be 2448 cell
  files and a file called ``grid.nc``, which contains the information about which grid point is stored in which file.
  This allows us to read a whole 5x5 degree area into memory and iterate over the time series quickly.

  .. image:: 5x5_cell_partitioning.png
     :target: _images/5x5_cell_partitioning.png

This conversion can be performed using the ``smos_repurpose`` command line
program. An example would be:

.. code-block:: shell

   smos_ic_repurpose /image_data /timeseries/data 2011-01-01 2011-01-02

Which would take GLDAS Noah data stored in ``/gldas_data`` from January 1st
2011 to January 2nd 2011 and store all parameters in the image files as time
series in the folder ``/timeseries/data``.

Conversion to time series is performed by the `repurpose package
<https://github.com/TUW-GEO/repurpose>`_ in the background. For custom settings
or other options see the `repurpose documentation
<http://repurpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and the code in
``smos.smos_ic.reshuffle``.

**Note**: If a ``RuntimeError: NetCDF: Bad chunk sizes.`` appears during reshuffling, consider downgrading the
netcdf4 library via:

.. code-block:: shell

  conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4=1.2.2
